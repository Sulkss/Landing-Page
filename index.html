            <h1>This Is a Page Supporting Tom Nook!</h1>
            <p>We all love living with our animal friends on various locations, mainly owning our own islands and deciding who gets to live there and enjoy a little slice of heaven. Aw Perfect.
                we can all appreicate the hard work it takes to get our island to the world famous 5 Star Rating, a goal for most! It's what we dream of, the ultimate goal!
                However, there is always one thing most people tend to forget about, our good friend Mr Tom Nook, everyone just calls him greedy and not caring about his feelings or the 
                hard work he puts into securing these assests and land for you! Here he is pictured working day and night just to help you reach your goals. If you would kindly, please take a moment
                to learn more about the great man himself.

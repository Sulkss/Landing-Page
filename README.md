# Landing-Page
This is my first project where I will be building a website landing page from scratch with material I have learnt from The Odin Project, I will also be using notes I have created along with
resources on google to aid in creating this project.

I will first start off with doing the HTML Code, with creating Classes and ID's. It might be easier to keep this until the end and jump into the HTML and edit when needed.
I have a list of criteria to follow .

**UPDATE**

I have finally finished my first website with help from my notes and some looking on google, it was quite the journey, think over a week or so with work but finally got it done and understand the concepts a bit better now!

Was quite duanting at first with CSS, with stuff like parents and children, it was rather difficult for me to understand at first. 
I even made a firt website that was just horrible and not worth looking at haha, I may go back and sort that one out though, to help myself learn.

It was really  fun and will be sure to input the code as i learn in moving forward now to get a better grasp of it all.
